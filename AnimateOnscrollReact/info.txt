depend on animate.css. you can install:
    npm: npm i animate.css
    yarn: yarn add animate.css

    or you can also use it via cdn.

Issues: haven't tested it yet for all cases.
        1. There is a flicker when using animation that are horizontal such as zoom or slide up/down.


pull requests are welcomed :)
